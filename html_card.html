<h1>HOUR OF CODE: HOLIDAY CARD</h1> 
Here are the tools for a typical Hour of Code lesson to build a basic holiday card in HTML. This lesson has been adapted by Kate Stohr to work in a setting using Google Classroom on a Chromebook where uploading and downloading files has been limited by the school IT administrator.  

<strong>Step 1: Code editor</strong>
Open this HTML editor in your Chromebook browser. 
http://www.w3schools.com/

<strong>Step 2: Code Documentation</strong>
Load the documentation for basic HTML code in another tab in your browser. Here's a good cheatsheet:

<strong>Step 3: Color Picker</strong>
If you want to change the color of your text, you can find the codes for colors here:

<strong>Example holiday card:</strong>

To add an image to your holiday card, copy the 'image address' by right clicking (press 'ALT' then click on the image on a Chromebook) on one of the images below. 

To save your work, click the Google Drive symbol in the Tryit Editor. To share your work, click the disk or save symbol. That will give you a link to share with others.

Note: If you want to try an exercise to introduce the concept of coding without computers before launching into HTML, try this: https://code.org/files/fuzzFamilyFrenzy.pdf 

(We build an obstacle course outside the classroom with duct tape, tables and chairs. Kids pair up and write code for each other as if they were an alien trying to get through the obstacle course.) 

<strong>How to debug your code:</strong> 
Follow these steps in this order to solve coding errors: 

Check the documentation 
Check your code for typos, placement, syntax 
Explain your code to a friend.
Compare your code to an example that works 
Ask for help

<strong>Things to keep in mind:</strong> 

URL = The web address of the page or image you want to link to or display. 

Control C = copy
Control V = paste
Control Z = undo
