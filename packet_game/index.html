<h1>HOUR OF CODE: PACKET GAME</h1>

<div class="intro">
<p>Hour of Code activity focused on computer networks and cybersecurity. The Packet Game is a role playing game designed to help students understand how information travels the Internet (“packets”) and teaches basic concepts of cyber security.It is a role playing game and does not require students to use a computer. </p>
<p>Inspired by: <a href="https://www.cynja.com/" target="_blank">The Cynja</a>.</p>

<h2>MATERIALS</h2>
<p> Designed for 20-30 students (modify as needed).</p>

<ul>
  <li>90 IP addressed packets (3-4 “packets” per student). Each packet is an envelope labeled with an IP address that contains a card inside that has a picture of the type of traffic being delivered. Most packets will contain safe pictures. Some will have pictures of cyber security threats.</li>
  <li>3 Security protocol cards.  Cards with pictures that represent a type of security protocol than can be used to prevent cyber attacks. (i.e. firewall, strong password, security preferences)</li>
  <li>6 manila envelopes labeled with corresponding IP addresses each representing a network device</li>
  <li>1 Timer</li>
  <li>Large blackboard, white board or cork board.</li>
  <li>2-3 game moderators (volunteers/teacher)</li>

<h2>SAMPLE IP ADDRESSES</h2>

<p>
205.215.31.136<br>

189.248.109.106<br>

30.12.247.111<br>

219.171.138.159<br>

34.228.159.26<br>
</p>

<h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>

<p>The objective of the game is for the students to work together to safely deliver all of the packets to the correct IP address by matching the IP address on the card with the IP address on the network device. Along the way they will need to learn to recognize cyber security threats , ‘quarantine’ malicious packets, and put in place security protocols to keep the network safe.</p>
<p>This role-playing game is designed to enable students to learn as they go. No advance preparation is needed and in fact knowing too much could ruin the fun!</p>

<h2>MODERATORS</h2>

<p>The game requires at least two moderators:</p>


<p><strong>Network Security Specialist</strong></p>

<p>The role of the first moderator is to help students determine if the packet they are carrying is ‘safe’ or ‘unsafe.’  Students who have a question about the image on the back of their card should go to the ‘Network Security Specialist” for help. The Network Security Specialist will have a list of common cyber threats. (See ‘Game FAQ’). Their role is to guide the student in assessing whether or not their packet card is ‘safe’ and can be delivered or presents a ‘threat’ and should be quarantined.  In doing so, the Network Security Specialist should take time to explain and help students understand the source of the threat and the different ways to protect against it.  If a cyber attack occurs, the Network Specialist should help students trace and quarantine the threat and is tasked with announcing when the threat has been neutralized.</p>

<p><strong>Game Moderator (aka the ‘Hacker’)</strong></p>
<p>The role of the second moderator is to play the ‘Hacker.’  This moderator, referred to in the game to students simply as the ‘Game Moderator’, is responsible for instigating and managing cyber attacks. The goal of the Hacker is to ensure that cyber attacks occur early (and if desired, often!) in the game. It is the Hacker’s job to discreetly slip one or more packets containing cyber threats into the hands of the players. How they do it is up to them. Once a threat is in play and is sent to the Router, the Hacker will announce that the network has been attacked. The Hacker then instructs the student who is playing the role of the Router to sit down and stop routing traffic. Once the network has been attacked, students can no longer deliver packets until the class has successfully traced the type of threat, placed the malicious packet in quarantine and put an appropriate security measure in place.  Throughout the game, the Hacker should continually work to figure out the best and fastest way to take down the network all while keeping his/her true identity a secret. At no time during the game should the Hacker reveal to students that he/she is the Hacker.</p>


<h2>SETUP</h2>

<p>The classroom blackboard should be divided into three sections and labeled accordingly. The three sections are 1) network 2) quarantine and 3) security. The majority of the blackboard should be devoted to ‘network’ with smaller sections at student height demarcated for ‘quarantine’ and ‘protection’.</p>
<p>Place all the IP-addressed packet envelopes into a brown bag. Or, if in table groups, divide the packets evenly amongst the table groups, one bag per group. Students should draw packets at random and should not open the envelopes until instructed to do so by the Router.  Remember some packets will contain cybersecurity threats.</p>

<h2>HOW TO PLAY</h2>

<p>To setup the game, students must first build the network.  To do this, students can raise their hands, or if in table groups, one student from each table group picks out a ‘network device’ and tapes that manila envelope to the blackboard in front of the classroom.  The student should very briefly explain/share what the device is to the class. Each device is labeled with an IP address. This is where ‘packets’ will be delivered. NOTE: As the students are building the network, the Network Security Specialist should explain basic concepts (i.e. that the Internet is a computer network, what an IP address is, and how information is sent in packets from one computer to another via a router.)</p>
<p>Next, one or more students are assigned the role of playing the Router. The Router is in charge of managing network traffic by pointing to students and letting them know when it is there turn to deliver their packet. The Router has only the time allowed on the timer to make sure all traffic is delivered safely to the correct IP address.</p>
<p>To start the game the student playing the role of the Router will point to a student and ask them to draw one packet from the brown bag containing packets and bring it to the Router. The timer is then started. The identified student must show the IP Address on the packet to the Router before continuing on to deliver the packet to device matching the correct IP address. Once the student has checked in with the Router and is sent by the Router to deliver their packet, the Router may point to another student to draw a packet from the brown bag and bring it to the Router. After leaving the Router and before delivering the card, each student must open the packet and check the picture on the card inside to determine if it is ‘safe’ or ‘unsafe’ to deliver.  If the card is ‘safe’ students should place it into the manila envelope on the blackboard that matches the IP address on the card.  If the card is ‘unsafe’ they should ‘quarantine’ it by taping it to the quarantine section of the blackboard. If they have a question about whether or not the packet is safe they should check with the Network Security Specialist before delivering it!  Be careful! Play continues until all of the packets have been delivered. It is expected and encouraged that the Router will develop ever more efficient ways to direct traffic to enable all of the packets to be delivered in the time allotted. It is up to the Router to figure out how best to do that.</p>
<p>If at any point in the game it is announced that the network has been compromised by a cyber attack, the student playing the Router must lie or sit down on the floor and stop routing traffic. Students can no longer deliver packets until the class has successfully traced the type of threat, placed the malicious packet in quarantine and put appropriate network security in place to prevent future similar attacks.  They should consult with the Network Security Specialist for help. If a threat has already accidentally been delivered to a network device, the students must track it down by checking through each of the envelopes and place it in quarantine.  Once the Network Security Specialist announces that the threat is ‘neutralized’ , the Game Moderator instructs the Router to ‘restart’ and play continues.</p>
<p>Plan for each student to make 2-3 round trips to the blackboard. The students collectively ‘win’ the game if all of the packets are delivered in the time allotted, all cyber threats are quarantined and no cyber threats are allowed to be delivered to any of the devices in the network.  If not, the Hacker wins the game.</p>

<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
<p>Several of the students will have had the unhappy fortune of having had to deliver cyber threats. After the game, these students should be invited to start a discussion by coming to the front of the classroom and one by one explaining to the rest of the class the name and nature of the threat and the best way to protect against it in real life.</p>
<p>Time permitting, students can guess the identify of the Hacker.  Alternately, the Game Moderator (aka the Hacker) may announce his or her true identity.</p>
<p>The rest of the available time can be spent discussing cyber threats in real life and how best to protect themselves and their families as they browse the Internet.</p>

<h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>

<ol>
  <li>A network is just a number of computers/devices that have each been assigned an IP address so that they can send information ("packets") to each other. The internet is an open, public network.</li>
  <li>Most information on the internet is safe; some information is unsafe. Browsing the internet is just like walking on a city street. You need to be aware:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't click on ads. (malvertising is the most common cyber threat)
        <li>Look out for and read any popups that appear on your screen. (drive-by-downloads; malware)
        <li>Don't respond to emails from friends that don't quite sound like your friend. (phishing)
        <li>Don't share personal information by email or on social media (social engineering)
        <li>Use strong passwords and don't share passwords (spyware)
        <li>Look out for changes in how your computer works (i.e. new homepage) (worms, trojans, viruses)
     </ul>
  <li>If you see something, say something. Tell a parent or teacher.</li>
</ol>
